A simple web homepage for practice with CSS, HTML, and frameworks like Foundation.<br /><br />

Current version:<br /><br />

Uses simple JS and HTML with Foundation 5.0.2 to display some links, as well as the current date and time.<br /><br />

RENOVATION IN PROGRESS:
We're planning on dropping the foundation framework in the next revision.<br />
This project started as a solo affair, and since someone else has taken interest,<br />
it's now as good a time as ever to rebuild the page with the intent of building for<br />
more users than just myself. That said, the reno will be kept on a separate branch<br />
until things are ready. BLESS THIS MESS<br /><br />
